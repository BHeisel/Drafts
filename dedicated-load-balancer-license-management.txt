### Overview

CenturyLink Cloud dedicated Load Balancer provisioned in a customer's environment are customer managed devices, which includes management of the vendor license. Dedicated Load Balancers are typically provisioned with a license with an expiration date of one year. An expired license may impact functionality of the Load Balancer. To obtain a new license a [Support Request](../Support/how-do-i-report-a-support-issue.md) should be submitted.

### Audience

CenturyLink Cloud customers with a dedicated Citrix Netscaler Load Balancer

### Prerequisites

* Must have an Admin login to your netscaler
* Must be able to SSH to the RNAT IP of the HA pair (typically ends with .101)
* Basic understanding of [Basic Management Using the CLI](../Network/dedicated-load-balancer-using-cli-basic-management.md)

### Detailed Steps

The Netscaler Load Balancer uses FlexLM licensing to license features on the product. A license check is done when the VPX boots. The licensing daemon (service) will start, check for a valid license and then stop the daemon (service). The VPX will then enable certain features determined by the license daemon (service). If a license is expired or invalid, the Netscaler will stop passing traffic.

#### How to determine if a VPX is not passing traffic due to an expired license

##### CLI method

1. SSH or use PuTTY on Windows to login to VPX management IP 
2. In the CLI run:
 ```
  show ns license
 ```
3. Review the output.  If the Model Number ID lists 1 instead of the proper model and the Load Balancing feature says NO, the license is expired.  The Model ID should read the correct model (ie: 200) and the Load Balancing feature should say YES.

##### GUI method

Open a browser and login to the VPX management IP.  Firefox works well with the VPX.
On the left hand side menu, navigate to System->Licenses
Review output.  If the Model ID lists 1 instead of the proper model and the Load Balancing feature does not have a green checkmark, you have an expired license.  The Model ID should reflect the correct model (ie: 200) and the Load Balancing feature should have a green checkmark.


### Notes

* Multiple licenses (including expired ones) can be present on the system. The Netscaler will enable all of the proper features from the valid license file.
* The Netscaler GUI and CLI will display licensing status, they will not display the expiration date. The actual license file must be reviewed to determine the expiration date.
* A new license can be added to a running Netscaler while it is running with an expired license. Upon restart, the Netscaler will use the new license, resulting in less downtime of the pools.
* Updating the license on a Netscaler HA pair can be performed without downtime.
